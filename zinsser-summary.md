# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Evelyn Luu

People are taught to use fancy words and write complicated sentences. This habit creates terrible writers. Good writing is clear, simple, and uncluttered. In chapter 2, “Simplicity”, Zinsser says to make every sentence easy to read. Each word should have a purpose in the sentence. After reading a passage, the reader should not feel confused about the writer’s message. In chapter 3, “Clutter”, Zinsser says to remove clutter from a sentence by avoiding unnecessary adjectives and prepositions. Short words can replace long words that have the same meaning. The main goal is to “simplify”.
